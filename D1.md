## Response:

```
"""
Constructs the base prompt for the chatbot agent.

The function adds a system message with the current time and date to the `prepend_messages` list. It also adds budget information to the prompt if the total budget is greater than 0.0. The remaining budget is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total budget. If the remaining budget is less than 0, it is set to 0. The budget information is added as a system message to the `append_messages` list.

Args:
    self: The instance of the class.

Returns:
    ChatSequence: The constructed base prompt.

Example:
    ```python
    agent = Agent()
    prompt = agent.construct_base_prompt()
    print(prompt)
    ```
