## Coding Assistant Command: 

`Optimize Performance`

## Response:

```
Description of improvements:

Performance limitation: The code currently uses the replace method to flatten paragraphs by replacing newline characters with spaces. This can be inefficient for large texts.
Suggested improvement: Instead of using replace, use the join method to concatenate the paragraphs with spaces.

Performance limitation: The code iterates over the sentences multiple times to calculate the target chunk length and create chunks of approximately equal size.
Suggested improvement: Combine the calculations and chunk creation into a single iteration over the sentences to improve efficiency.

Improved code:
