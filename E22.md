            print(f"{destination_path} already exists, skipping ...")
    else:
        for mirror in MIRRORS:
            url = mirror + resource
            print(f"Downloading {url} ...")
            try:
                hook = None if quiet else report_download_progress
                urlretrieve(url, destination_path, reporthook=hook)
            except (URLError, ConnectionError) as e:
                print(f"Failed to download (trying next):\n{e}")

            finally:
                if not quiet:

`Explain Code`

## Response:

```
What?
The download function is responsible for downloading a resource from a list of mirrors and saving it to a specified destination path.

How?
The function first checks if the destination path already exists. If it does, and the quiet flag is not set, it prints a message indicating that the file already exists and skips the download. If the destination path does not exist, the function iterates over a list of mirrors and attempts to download the resource from each mirror. It uses the urlretrieve function from the urllib.request module to download the resource. If the download is successful, it breaks out of the loop. If all mirrors fail, it raises a RuntimeError.

Coupling and Cohesion
The function is moderately coupled as it interacts with the file system and makes network requests. It is cohesive as it encapsulates the functionality related to downloading a resource.

Single Responsibility Principle
The code follows the Single Responsibility Principle. The function is responsible for downloading a resource and does not have any additional responsibilities.

Unusual Things
There are no unusual things in the code.

Highly Suspicious
There are no highly suspicious things in the code.
