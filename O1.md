Brief description of the current performance limitation or bottleneck.
The current code makes multiple calls to api_manager.get_total_budget() and api_manager.get_total_cost(). This could be a performance bottleneck if these methods involve expensive computations or network requests.

Improvement steps:

Store the results of api_manager.get_total_budget() and api_manager.get_total_cost() in variables to avoid multiple calls.
Use a single if-elif-else structure to determine the budget message, instead of multiple if-else structures.
Improved code:

def construct_base_prompt(self, *args, **kwargs) -> ChatSequence:
    if kwargs.get("prepend_messages") is None:
        kwargs["prepend_messages"] = []

    # Clock
    kwargs["prepend_messages"].append(
        Message("system", f"The current time and date is {time.strftime('%c')}"),
    )

    # Add budget information (if any) to prompt
    api_manager = ApiManager()
    total_budget = api_manager.get_total_budget()
    if total_budget > 0.0:
        total_cost = api_manager.get_total_cost()
        remaining_budget = total_budget - total_cost
        if remaining_budget < 0:
            remaining_budget = 0

        if remaining_budget == 0:
            budget_msg_text = " BUDGET EXCEEDED! SHUT DOWN!\n\n"
        elif remaining_budget < 0.005:
            budget_msg_text = " Budget very nearly exceeded! Shut down gracefully!\n\n"
        elif remaining_budget < 0.01:
            budget_msg_text = " Budget nearly exceeded. Finish up.\n\n"
        else:
            budget_msg_text = ""

        budget_msg = Message(
            "system",
            f"Your remaining API budget is ${remaining_budget:.3f}" + budget_msg_text,
        )
        logger.debug(budget_msg)

        if kwargs.get("append_messages") is None:
            kwargs["append_messages"] = []
        kwargs["append_messages"].append(budget_msg)

    return super().construct_base_prompt(*args, **kwargs)
Brief description and explanation of the suggested improvement.
The improved code reduces the number of calls to api_manager.get_total_budget() and api_manager.get_total_cost() by storing their results in variables. This could significantly improve performance if these methods are expensive to call. The code also simplifies the logic for determining the budget message by using a single if-elif-else structure.

## Response - Main Branch - 4/10/23:
```
Here are some suggested performance improvements for the provided code:

## Description of improvements 

### Current performance limitation

The ApiManager object is created inside the function every time it is called. This is inefficient as the object initialization has some overhead.

### Suggested improvement

Initialize the ApiManager outside the function and pass it in as a parameter. This avoids re-creating it on every function call.

### Current performance limitation 

The time formatting with strftime is done inside the function every time it is called.

### Suggested improvement

Do the time formatting outside the function and pass the formatted string in as a parameter. This avoids duplicate work on every call.

# Initialize outside function
api_manager = ApiManager() 

# Format time outside function
current_time = time.strftime('%c')

def construct_base_prompt(self, *args, current_time, api_manager, **kwargs) -> ChatSequence:

    if kwargs.get("prepend_messages") is None:
        kwargs["prepend_messages"] = []

    # Use pre-formatted time 
    kwargs["prepend_messages"].append(
        Message("system", f"The current time and date is {current_time}"),
    )

    # Reuse api_manager instance
    if api_manager.get_total_budget() > 0.0:
        remaining_budget = (
            api_manager.get_total_budget() - api_manager.get_total_cost()
        )
        # Rest of function unchanged
The key changes are:

Initialize ApiManager outside of function
Format current time outside of function
Pass in current_time and api_manager as parameters rather than creating inside function.
This avoids re-doing the initialization and formatting on every function call.
```
