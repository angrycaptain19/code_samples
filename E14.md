`Explain Code`

## Response:

```
What?
The CommandParser class is a customized version of the ArgumentParser class from the argparse module. It improves error messages and prevents SystemExit in certain situations when a command is called programmatically.

How?
The class overrides the __init__, parse_args, error, and add_subparsers methods of the ArgumentParser class to provide the desired behavior. It adds functionality to catch missing arguments for better error messages, handles errors differently depending on whether the command is called from the command line or programmatically, and modifies the behavior of add_subparsers to use the customized CommandParser class for subparsers.

Coupling and Cohesion
The class is moderately coupled as it inherits from ArgumentParser and interacts with its methods. However, it has a clear and focused responsibility of customizing the behavior of the argument parser.

Single Responsibility Principle
The code follows the Single Responsibility Principle. The CommandParser class has a single responsibility of customizing the behavior of the argument parser and does not have any additional responsibilities that need to be extracted into separate functions.

Unusual Things
The CommandParser class overrides the error method to raise a CommandError instead of calling sys.exit(). This is done to prevent SystemExit when the command is called programmatically.
Highly Suspicious
There are no highly suspicious elements in this code.
