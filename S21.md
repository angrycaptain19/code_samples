## Code Snippet:

```
    def expand(self, batch_shape, _instance=None):
        new = self._get_checked_instance(Uniform, _instance)
        batch_shape = torch.Size(batch_shape)
        new.low = self.low.expand(batch_shape)
        new.high = self.high.expand(batch_shape)
        super(Uniform, new).__init__(batch_shape, validate_args=False)
        new._validate_args = self._validate_args
        return new
```

## Response:

```
def expand(self, batch_shape, _instance=None):
    new = self._get_checked_instance(Uniform, _instance)
    new.low = self.low.expand(batch_shape)
    new.high = self.high.expand(batch_shape)
    new._validate_args = self._validate_args
    return new
Changes Made:

Removed the unnecessary assignment of batch_shape to torch.Size(batch_shape) as it is not used.
Removed the call to super().__init__() as it is not necessary since new is already an instance of Uniform.
```
