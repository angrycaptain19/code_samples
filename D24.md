## Response:

```
"""
Run a million events through state changed event helper with 1000 entities.

This function benchmarks the performance of the state changed event helper in Home Assistant. It sets up an event listener for state changed events for a list of entity IDs and fires a large number of state changed events for one of the entities. The function measures the time it takes for the event listener to handle all the events and returns the elapsed time.

Args:
    hass: The Home Assistant instance.

Returns:
    float: The elapsed time in seconds.

Example:
    ```python
    hass = HomeAssistant()
    elapsed_time = await state_changed_event_helper(hass)
    print(f"Elapsed time: {elapsed_time} seconds")
    ```
