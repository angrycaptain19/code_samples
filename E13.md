## Code Snippet:

```
    def check_replacements(self):
        """
        Mark replacement migrations applied if their replaced set all are.

        Do this unconditionally on every migrate, rather than just when
        migrations are applied or unapplied, to correctly handle the case
        when a new squash migration is pushed to a deployment that already had
        all its replaced migrations applied. In this case no new migration will
        be applied, but the applied state of the squashed migration must be
        maintained.
        """
        applied = self.recorder.applied_migrations()
        for key, migration in self.loader.replacements.items():
            all_applied = all(m in applied for m in migration.replaces)
            if all_applied and key not in applied:
                self.recorder.record_applied(*key)

`Explain Code`

## Response:

```
What?
The check_replacements method is responsible for marking replacement migrations as applied if all of their replaced migrations are already applied.

How?
The method retrieves the list of applied migrations and iterates over the replacement migrations. For each replacement migration, it checks if all of its replaced migrations are in the list of applied migrations. If all replaced migrations are applied and the replacement migration itself is not already marked as applied, it records the replacement migration as applied.

Coupling and Cohesion
The method is moderately coupled as it interacts with the recorder and loader objects. However, it has a clear and focused responsibility of handling replacement migrations.

Single Responsibility Principle
The code follows the Single Responsibility Principle. It handles the marking of replacement migrations and does not have any additional responsibilities that need to be extracted into separate functions.

There are no unusual things in this code.
