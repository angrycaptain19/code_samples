## Code Snippet:

```
    def expand(self, batch_shape, _instance=None):
        new = self._get_checked_instance(Uniform, _instance)
        batch_shape = torch.Size(batch_shape)
        new.low = self.low.expand(batch_shape)
        new.high = self.high.expand(batch_shape)
        super(Uniform, new).__init__(batch_shape, validate_args=False)
        new._validate_args = self._validate_args
        return new
```

`Explain Code`

## Response:

```
What?
The expand method is part of the Uniform class. It is used to create a new instance of the Uniform distribution with expanded batch shape.

How?
The method takes the batch_shape as input and creates a new instance of the Uniform class. It expands the low and high attributes of the new instance to match the specified batch_shape. The method then sets the _validate_args attribute of the new instance and returns it.

Coupling and Cohesion
The method is moderately coupled to the Uniform class as it accesses and modifies its attributes. It is cohesive as it encapsulates the functionality related to expanding the batch shape of the distribution.

Single Responsibility Principle
The code follows the Single Responsibility Principle. The method is responsible for expanding the batch shape of the Uniform distribution and does not have any additional responsibilities.

Unusual Things
There are no unusual things in the code.

Highly Suspicious
There are no highly suspicious things in the code.
