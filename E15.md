## Code Snippet:

```
def get_exception_response(request, resolver, status_code, exception):
    try:
        callback = resolver.resolve_error_handler(status_code)
        response = callback(request, exception=exception)
    except Exception:
        signals.got_request_exception.send(sender=None, request=request)
        response = handle_uncaught_exception(request, resolver, sys.exc_info())

    return response
```

`Explain Code`

## Response:

```
What?
The get_exception_response function is responsible for handling exceptions that occur during request processing and returning an appropriate response based on the exception and status code.

How?
The function first attempts to resolve an error handler callback for the given status code using the provided resolver. If an error handler is found, it calls the callback with the request and exception as arguments to generate a response. If an exception occurs during this process, it sends a got_request_exception signal and falls back to the handle_uncaught_exception function to generate a response.

Coupling and Cohesion
The function is moderately coupled as it depends on the resolver and the handle_uncaught_exception function. However, it has a clear and focused responsibility of handling exceptions and returning appropriate responses.

Single Responsibility Principle
The code follows the Single Responsibility Principle. The get_exception_response function has a single responsibility of handling exceptions and returning responses. There are no additional responsibilities that need to be extracted into separate functions.
