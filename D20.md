## Code Snippet:

```
class _DropoutNd(Module):
    __constants__ = ['p', 'inplace']
    p: float
    inplace: bool

    def __init__(self, p: float = 0.5, inplace: bool = False) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        if p < 0 or p > 1:
            raise ValueError(f"dropout probability has to be between 0 and 1, but got {p}")
        self.p = p
        self.inplace = inplace

    def extra_repr(self) -> str:
        return f'p={self.p}, inplace={self.inplace}'
```

## Response:

```
"""
_DropoutNd class represents a dropout layer that randomly sets elements of the input tensor to zero with a given probability during training.

Attributes:
    p (float): Dropout probability, between 0 and 1.
    inplace (bool): Flag indicating whether to apply dropout in-place.

Methods:
    __init__(self, p: float = 0.5, inplace: bool = False) -> None: Initializes the _DropoutNd instance.
    extra_repr(self) -> str: Returns a string representation of the dropout layer's parameters.
