## Code Snippet:

```
    def check_replacements(self):
        """
        Mark replacement migrations applied if their replaced set all are.

        Do this unconditionally on every migrate, rather than just when
        migrations are applied or unapplied, to correctly handle the case
        when a new squash migration is pushed to a deployment that already had
        all its replaced migrations applied. In this case no new migration will
        be applied, but the applied state of the squashed migration must be
        maintained.
        """
        applied = self.recorder.applied_migrations()
        for key, migration in self.loader.replacements.items():
            all_applied = all(m in applied for m in migration.replaces)
            if all_applied and key not in applied:
                self.recorder.record_applied(*key)

```
Here's a simplified version of the code:

def check_replacements(self):
    """
    Mark replacement migrations applied if their replaced set all are.

    Do this unconditionally on every migrate, rather than just when
    migrations are applied or unapplied, to correctly handle the case
    when a new squash migration is pushed to a deployment that already had
    all its replaced migrations applied. In this case no new migration will
    be applied, but the applied state of the squashed migration must be
    maintained.
    """
    applied = self.recorder.applied_migrations()
    replacements = self.loader.replacements.items()
    replacements_to_apply = [
        key for key, migration in replacements
        if all(m in applied for m in migration.replaces) and key not in applied
    ]
    self.recorder.record_applied(*replacements_to_apply)
The simplified code uses a list comprehension to filter the replacement migrations that need to be marked as applied. It checks if all the replaced migrations are already applied and if the replacement migration itself is not already marked as applied. Then, it calls self.recorder.record_applied() with the filtered replacements to mark them as applied.
