## Code Snippet:

```
    def _fetch_sites(self, token: str) -> list[Site] | None:
        configuration = amberelectric.Configuration(access_token=token)
        api = amber_api.AmberApi.create(configuration)

        try:
            sites = api.get_sites()
            if len(sites) == 0:
                self._errors[CONF_API_TOKEN] = "no_site"
                return None
            return sites
        except amberelectric.ApiException as api_exception:
            if api_exception.status == 403:
                self._errors[CONF_API_TOKEN] = "invalid_api_token"
            else:
                self._errors[CONF_API_TOKEN] = "unknown_error"
            return None

## Response:

```
What?
The _fetch_sites method retrieves a list of sites from the Amber Electric API using an access token. It handles different scenarios such as no sites being available, an invalid API token, or an unknown error.

How?
The method creates an instance of the Amber Electric API client using the provided access token. It then calls the get_sites method to retrieve the list of sites. If the list is empty, it sets an error message and returns None. If an ApiException occurs, it checks the status code to determine the specific error and sets an appropriate error message.

Coupling and Cohesion
The method has low coupling as it only interacts with the Amber Electric API client and does not depend on other external dependencies. It has high cohesion as it focuses on fetching and handling site data from the API.

Single Responsibility Principle
This code follows the Single Responsibility Principle. The method is responsible for fetching sites from the API and handling different scenarios related to the API response.

Unusual Things
The use of the _errors dictionary to store error messages related to the API token.
Highly Suspicious
None
