## Code Snippet:

```
def get_exception_response(request, resolver, status_code, exception):
    try:
        callback = resolver.resolve_error_handler(status_code)
        response = callback(request, exception=exception)
    except Exception:
        signals.got_request_exception.send(sender=None, request=request)
        response = handle_uncaught_exception(request, resolver, sys.exc_info())

    return response
```

## Coding Assistant Command: 

`Simplify Code`

## Response:

```
Here's a simplified version of the code:

def get_exception_response(request, resolver, status_code, exception):
    try:
        callback = resolver.resolve_error_handler(status_code)
        response = callback(request, exception=exception)
    except Exception as ex:
        signals.got_request_exception.send(sender=None, request=request)
        response = handle_uncaught_exception(request, resolver, (type(ex), ex, ex.__traceback__))

    return response
The simplified code does not change the functionality of the original code. It only adds the exception type, exception instance, and traceback to the handle_uncaught_exception function call to match the expected arguments.
```
