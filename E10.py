## Code Snippet:

```
    def get_indices(
        self, enc: "tokenizers.Encoding", s: int, e: int, sequence_index: int, align_to_words: bool
    ) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        if align_to_words:
            try:
                start_word = enc.token_to_word(s)
                end_word = enc.token_to_word(e)
                start_index = enc.word_to_chars(start_word, sequence_index=sequence_index)[0]
                end_index = enc.word_to_chars(end_word, sequence_index=sequence_index)[1]
            except Exception:
                # Some tokenizers don't really handle words. Keep to offsets then.
                start_index = enc.offsets[s][0]
                end_index = enc.offsets[e][1]
        else:
            start_index = enc.offsets[s][0]
            end_index = enc.offsets[e][1]
        return start_index, end_index

## Response:

```
What?
The get_indices function takes an encoding object, start and end indices, a sequence index, and a flag indicating whether to align to words. It returns the start and end indices of the corresponding tokens or words in the encoding object.

How?
The function first checks if align_to_words is True. If so, it tries to get the start and end indices of the words corresponding to the given token indices using the token_to_word and word_to_chars methods of the encoding object. If an exception occurs (indicating that the tokenizer doesn't handle words), it falls back to using the token offsets. If align_to_words is False, it directly uses the token offsets.

Coupling and Cohesion
The function is tightly coupled to the tokenizers.Encoding class, as it relies on its methods to get the start and end indices. It has high cohesion as it performs a single task of getting the indices based on the alignment flag.

Single Responsibility Principle
The function follows the Single Responsibility Principle as it has a clear and focused responsibility of getting the indices based on the alignment flag. There are no pieces that should be extracted into a separate function.

Unusual Things
The function uses a try-except block to handle the case where the tokenizer doesn't handle words. This is an unusual construct as it relies on an exception to determine the control flow.
The function uses type hints with quotes ("tokenizers.Encoding") instead of importing the actual type. This is an unusual practice and can make the code less readable.
Highly Suspicious
There are no highly suspicious things in this code.
