        when a new squash migration is pushed to a deployment that already had
        all its replaced migrations applied. In this case no new migration will
        be applied, but the applied state of the squashed migration must be
        maintained.

Current Performance Limitation or Bottleneck
The current performance limitation lies in the line where we check if all replaced migrations are applied. This is done using a generator expression within the all() function. This can be inefficient if migration.replaces is a large list, as all() has to iterate over the entire list, and for each item, check if it's in the applied set, which is a potentially costly operation.

Improvement Steps

Convert applied to a set to speed up membership tests.
Use a set intersection to check if all migrations are applied, which is faster than using all() with a generator expression.
Improved Code

Brief Description and Explanation of the Suggested Improvement
The improved code converts applied to a set, which allows for faster membership tests. It then uses the issubset() method to check if all migrations are applied. This is faster than using all() with a generator expression, especially for large lists, as issubset() can take advantage of set operations to perform this check more efficiently.
```

## Response - Current Main Branch - 4/10/23:
```
No clear performance improvements found in the provided code snippet.

The check_replacements function is checking if any replacement migrations should be marked as applied based on their replaced migrations being applied.

The key aspects that make it performant:

It retrieves the set of applied migrations once rather than for each loop iteration. This avoids redundant work.

The all() call short circuits early if any migration is not applied. This avoids checking all migrations unnecessarily.

It uses a simple loop rather than complex logic. This follows basic Pythonic idioms.

Overall the implementation seems optimized to:

Avoid redundant work retrieving applied migrations.
Short circuit migration check using all().
Use straightforward logic over complex alternatives.
No obvious bottlenecks or areas for improvement stand out. The logic is simple and streamlined. Caching/lookups are utilized appropriately.

Additional optimizations would likely require broader changes to how migration state is tracked and checked, which is beyond the scope of this snippet.

So no clear performance improvements can be made based on the given code. It follows general Python best practices for efficiency.
