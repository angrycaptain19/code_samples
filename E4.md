```
What?
The split_text function splits a given text into chunks of sentences, ensuring that each chunk does not exceed the maximum length. It yields each chunk of text as it is generated.

How?
The function takes the following parameters:

text: The text to split.
for_model: The model to chunk for, which determines the tokenizer and constraints.
config: The config object.
with_overlap (optional): Whether to allow overlap between chunks.
max_chunk_length (optional): The maximum length of a chunk.
The function first calculates the maximum length based on the provided parameters. It then flattens the paragraphs in the text for improved performance. Next, it tokenizes the text using the specified tokenizer and counts the total number of tokens. If the text length is less than the maximum length, it yields the entire text as a single chunk. Otherwise, it determines the target chunk length based on the number of chunks and starts processing the sentences.

The function iterates over the sentences and adds them to the current chunk until the expected chunk length exceeds the maximum length. At that point, it yields the current chunk, resets the chunk, and adds the current sentence to the new chunk. If a sentence is longer than the maximum length, it is chopped up into smaller chunks and processed again. The process continues until all sentences have been processed.

Coupling and Cohesion
The function has a moderate level of coupling, as it depends on the config object and the count_string_tokens and chunk_content functions. However, it maintains good cohesion by focusing on the specific task of splitting text into chunks.

Single Responsibility Principle
The function follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by performing a single task: splitting text into chunks. There are no additional responsibilities that should be extracted into separate functions.

Unusual Things
The function uses the yield keyword to generate chunks of text as they are processed, allowing for efficient memory usage when working with large texts.
The function uses the spacy library to tokenize the text and extract sentences.
The function handles cases where a sentence is longer than the maximum length by chopping it up into smaller chunks and processing them separately.
Highly Suspicious
There are no highly suspicious aspects in this code.
