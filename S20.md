## Code Snippet:

```
class _DropoutNd(Module):
    __constants__ = ['p', 'inplace']
    p: float
    inplace: bool

    def __init__(self, p: float = 0.5, inplace: bool = False) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        if p < 0 or p > 1:
            raise ValueError(f"dropout probability has to be between 0 and 1, but got {p}")
        self.p = p
        self.inplace = inplace

    def extra_repr(self) -> str:
        return f'p={self.p}, inplace={self.inplace}'
```

## Response:

```
class _DropoutNd(Module):
    __constants__ = ['p', 'inplace']

    def __init__(self, p: float = 0.5, inplace: bool = False) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        if not 0 <= p <= 1:
            raise ValueError(f"dropout probability has to be between 0 and 1, but got {p}")
        self.p = p
        self.inplace = inplace

    def extra_repr(self) -> str:
        return f'p={self.p}, inplace={self.inplace}'
Changes Made:

Removed the type hints for p and inplace attributes as they are already defined in __constants__.
Simplified the condition for checking the validity of p in the __init__ method.
```
