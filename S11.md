## Coding Assistant Command: 

`Simplify Code`

## Response:

```
Here's a simplified version of the code:

class LazyStream:
    def __init__(self, producer, length=None):
        self._producer = producer
        self.length = length
        self.position = 0
        self._unget_history = []

    def tell(self):
        return self.position

    def read(self, size=None):
        remaining = self.length if size is None else size
        if remaining is None:
            return b"".join(self)

        result = b""
        while remaining > 0:
            try:
                chunk = next(self)
            except StopIteration:
                break
            emitting = chunk[:remaining]
            self.unget(chunk[remaining:])
            remaining -= len(emitting)
            result += emitting

        return result

    def __next__(self):
        try:
            chunk = next(self._producer)
        except StopIteration:
            raise
        self.position += len(chunk)
        return chunk

    def close(self):
        self._producer = []

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def unget(self, bytes):
        if not bytes:
            return
        self.position -= len(bytes)
        self._unget_history.insert(0, len(bytes))
        self._unget_history = self._unget_history[:50]
        if self._unget_history.count(len(bytes)) > 40:
            raise SuspiciousMultipartForm("The multipart parser got stuck, which shouldn't happen with normal uploaded files. Check for malicious upload activity; if there is none, report this to the Django developers.")
The simplified code removes the _empty and _leftover attributes as they are not used. It also simplifies the read() method by directly appending the emitted chunks to the result instead of using a generator. The __next__() method is modified to raise StopIteration when the producer is exhausted. The unget() method is simplified by directly manipulating the _unget_history list and checking for suspicious behavior within the method.
