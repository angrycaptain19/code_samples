## Code Snippet:

```
    def expand(self, batch_shape, _instance=None):
        new = self._get_checked_instance(Uniform, _instance)
        batch_shape = torch.Size(batch_shape)
        new.low = self.low.expand(batch_shape)
        new.high = self.high.expand(batch_shape)
        super(Uniform, new).__init__(batch_shape, validate_args=False)
        new._validate_args = self._validate_args
        return new
```

    Test the expand method of the Uniform class.

    Arrange:
        - Create an instance of the Uniform class.

    Act:
        - Call the expand method with different batch shapes.

    Assert:
        - Check that the returned instance is of type Uniform.
        - Check that the low and high attributes of the returned instance are expanded correctly.
        - Check that the batch_shape attribute of the returned instance is set correctly.
        - Check that the _validate_args attribute of the returned instance is set correctly.

    uniform.low = torch.tensor(0.0)
    uniform.high = torch.tensor(1.0)

    batch_shape = (2, 3)
    expanded_uniform = uniform.expand(batch_shape)

    assert isinstance(expanded_uniform, Uniform)
    assert expanded_uniform.low.shape == batch_shape
    assert expanded_uniform.high.shape == batch_shape
    assert expanded_uniform.batch_shape == torch.Size(batch_shape)
    assert expanded_uniform._validate_args == uniform._validate_args

        
      

      
    
The test covers the expand method of the Uniform class. It tests the expansion of the low and high attributes of the returned instance, as well as the setting of the batch_shape and _validate_args attributes.
