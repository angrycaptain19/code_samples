## Code Snippet:

```
def get_exception_response(request, resolver, status_code, exception):
    try:
        callback = resolver.resolve_error_handler(status_code)
        response = callback(request, exception=exception)
    except Exception:
        signals.got_request_exception.send(sender=None, request=request)
        response = handle_uncaught_exception(request, resolver, sys.exc_info())

## Response:

```
"""
Executes the exception response process for a Django request.

The function attempts to resolve an error handler callback for the given status code using the provided resolver. If an error handler is found, it calls the callback with the request and exception as arguments to generate a response. If an exception occurs during this process, it sends a `got_request_exception` signal and falls back to the `handle_uncaught_exception` function to generate a response.

Args:
    request: The Django request object.
    resolver: The Django URL resolver.
    status_code: The HTTP status code.
    exception: The exception that occurred during request processing.

Returns:
    The response generated based on the exception and status code.

Example:
    ```python
    request = HttpRequest()
    resolver = get_resolver(get_urlconf())
    status_code = 404
    exception = Http404("Not Found")

    response = get_exception_response(request, resolver, status_code, exception)
    ```
