## Code Snippet:

```
    def get_indices(
        self, enc: "tokenizers.Encoding", s: int, e: int, sequence_index: int, align_to_words: bool
    ) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        if align_to_words:
            try:
                start_word = enc.token_to_word(s)
                end_word = enc.token_to_word(e)
                start_index = enc.word_to_chars(start_word, sequence_index=sequence_index)[0]
                end_index = enc.word_to_chars(end_word, sequence_index=sequence_index)[1]
            except Exception:
                # Some tokenizers don't really handle words. Keep to offsets then.
                start_index = enc.offsets[s][0]
                end_index = enc.offsets[e][1]
        else:
            start_index = enc.offsets[s][0]
            end_index = enc.offsets[e][1]
        return start_index, end_index

```
No clear performance improvements found in the provided code snippet.

The function converts between token, word, and character indices in an encoded sequence. The conversions rely on the Encoding object enc, which is passed in.

Without seeing how enc is initialized and used, there are no obvious ways to improve performance here. The conversions themselves seem optimized by operating on indices rather than iterating through tokens/words.

The only suggestion may be to cache the Encoding object enc if it is re-used across multiple calls. However, without broader context on how the function is used, it's not clear if this would improve performance.

Overall the function seems efficient for its purpose, and no clear optimizations are possible based on the given snippet alone.
